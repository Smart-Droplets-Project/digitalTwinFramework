# Example Output Data â€“ Digital Twin for Winter Wheat

This folder contains example output data generated by our digital twin system for winter wheat. The data illustrates how the system integrates crop model calibration, reinforcement learning (RL)-based decision making, and simulation of key crop variables over time.

The dataset corresponds to the scenario shown in the figure included in this folder, demonstrating:

- Variational calibration using observations of Development Stage (DVS) and Leaf Area Index (LAI),
- Simulation runs triggered by weather forecasts starting on 15 June,
- RL-recommended nitrogen applications on 20 March (60 kg), 10 April (80 kg), and 10 May (60 kg).
